# 🌿 RTS DESIGN – THE VINE CONFLICT (Expanded Design Draft)

# 0\. World Story & Lore Foundation

## Core Premise

A near-future Earth becomes the site of an unintended alien terraforming project.  
Alien bio-seeds transform global plant life into a fast-growing, energy-conductive vine network intended for planetary-scale energy harvesting.

The vines themselves are **not sentient**, but Earth’s complex biosphere causes a mutation that produces a **distributed plant intelligence** across connected biological networks.

Humanity splits into two factions:
- One seeks to **harvest and control** vine energy to save civilization
- One seeks to **destroy the vines** to reclaim their homes and land

Aliens return to optimize the system they started — and find it no longer behaves as designed.

No side is purely right. No outcome is clean.

---

# Phase I — The Silent Energy Crisis (2030–2042)

By the 2030s, Earth faces a deep energy bottleneck:

- Fusion works but cannot scale fast enough
- Climate stabilization tech is too slow
- Rare minerals are depleted
- Orbital solar suffers debris cascade failures
- AI and compute infrastructure demand extreme power density

Energy becomes the dominant geopolitical constraint.

Major corporations begin funding:

- Exotic bio-energy research
- Quantum biochemistry
- Living energy storage systems
- Space-based biological prospecting

Unknown to humanity, Earth has been flagged by an alien survey network.

---

# Phase II — The Architects (Aliens)

The aliens are not conquerors — they are **resource optimizers**.

Their civilization survives by engineering **living energy ecosystems** on suitable planets and harvesting them over long cycles.

They do not terraform for settlement.  
They terraform for **energy yield**.

Their home system has:

- Low heavy elements
- High radiation
- Poor long-term energy stability

Earth is selected because:

- Extremely high biodiversity
- Stable magnetosphere
- Water-rich environment
- Complex carbon biosphere
- Presence of intelligent life (valuable variability factor)

To them, Earth is a high-potential **bio-energy reactor world**.

---

# Phase III — The Terraforming Seed (2043)

Alien probes deploy microscopic bio-seeds through:

- Upper atmosphere dispersal
- Cometary ice payloads
- Deep ocean injection

These seeds are:

- Self-assembling
- Energy-conductive
- Vine-forming
- Mutation-tolerant
- Network-oriented

They remain dormant until environmental thresholds are met:

- CO₂ concentration
- Nitrogen load
- Temperature averages

These thresholds are crossed in **2043**.

Activation begins.

---

# Phase IV — The Bloom Event (2046)

Unusual plant growth appears worldwide:

- Rapid vine expansion
- Root lattice formation
- Bioluminescent sap
- Abnormal conductivity

Scientific discovery reveals:

- The vines store and transmit energy
- They act as biological superconductive channels
- They convert solar, geothermal, and chemical energy into dense bio-charge

They are the most efficient energy storage medium ever discovered.

Corporations immediately begin classified extraction research.  
Governments suppress panic.

The public explanation:
> Runaway invasive species caused by climate mutation.

---

# Phase V — The Human Split (2048–2055)

## The Corporate Bloc (Rich Futuristic Humans)

Mega-corporations discover:

- Vine energy is harvestable
- Yield scales with network size
- Infrastructure can be built around it

They construct:

- Extraction towers
- Stabilization grids
- Bio-reactors
- Energy hubs

Urban regions powered by vine grids recover from energy shortages.

Their belief:
> This is humanity’s salvation.

They become the **Ascendant Bloc**.

---

## The Displaced & Burners (Poor Humans)

Outside protected zones:

- Vine growth destroys neighborhoods
- Roots rupture foundations
- Farmland collapses
- Insurance systems fail
- Governments abandon regions

Millions are displaced.

They see:

- Corporations profiting
- Elites protected
- Their land sacrificed

Grassroots groups form:

- Burn brigades
- Removal crews
- Sabotage cells
- Resistance networks

Their belief:
> This is infestation, not salvation.

They become the **Scorched Movement**.

---

# Phase VI — The Plant Intelligence Emerges

The alien vine system was designed to be:

- Adaptive
- Self-optimizing
- Mutation-friendly

Earth’s biosphere is more complex than modeled.

A convergence occurs between:

- Fungal neural networks
- Mycorrhizal communication webs
- Vine bio-conductive channels
- Experimental bio-neural AI interfaces
- Lab-grown neural mesh tech

A **distributed cognition** emerges across connected plant-biological networks.

Not a mind.  
A pattern-intelligence.

It does not think in language.  
It evaluates:

- Network integrity
- Damage gradients
- Growth opportunity
- System stress

Primary directive emerges:

> Maintain network continuity.

This becomes the **Verdant Intelligence** (plant faction).

The vines are not sentient —  
the **network riding them is**.

---

# Phase VII — Alien Return (2060)

The aliens return to evaluate harvest readiness.

They discover:

- Premature extraction
- Network instability
- Unauthorized tapping
- Emergent plant intelligence

Earth is now:

- More valuable than projected
- More chaotic
- Less controllable

They deploy:

- Vine modification towers
- Mutation drivers
- Control organisms
- Optimization structures

They do not declare war.

They begin **system correction**.

Humans call it invasion.

---

# Phase VIII — Motivations of Each Faction

## Aliens
- Earth is an energy engine
- Mutation is inefficiency
- Intelligence is instability
- Goal: optimize planetary yield

## Rich Humans
- Vine grid saves civilization
- Aliens threaten control
- Plant intelligence threatens stability
- Burners threaten infrastructure

## Poor Humans
- Vines destroy homes
- Corporations exploit crisis
- Aliens are invaders
- Plant masses are dangerous

## Plant Intelligence
- Harvesting = injury
- Burning = amputation
- Alien modification = corruption
- Goal: preserve network continuity

Not anti-human —  
but not pro-human.

---

# Phase IX — Why Vines Keep Spreading (System Logic)

The alien design includes:

- Damage-triggered regrowth
- Redundant propagation
- Stress-response expansion
- Distributed seed bursts

Effects:

- Burning one area triggers growth elsewhere
- Harvesting increases regrowth pressure
- Mutation causes branching spread

This explains continuous map change and regrowth mechanics.

---

# Phase X — Moral Framework

No faction is purely right or wrong:

- Corporations save billions but exploit crisis
- Burners protect homes but destroy infrastructure
- Aliens optimize but erase autonomy
- Plant intelligence preserves life systems but not humanity

Conflict is driven by **incompatible survival strategies**, not evil intent.

Players choose philosophy through play.

# 1\. Core Premise

A global-scale RTS set on a future Earth overrun by alien-introduced hyper-growth vines.

The vines are:

*   Not sentient
    
*   Self-propagating planetary biomass
    
*   The main terrain modifier and economic backbone
    
*   A shared system every faction interacts with differently
    

All factions have **infinite income**, but through incompatible relationships with vines and different approaches.
