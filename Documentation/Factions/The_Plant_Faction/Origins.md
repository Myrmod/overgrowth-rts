# The Awakening

- The vines were never meant to think.They were:

- Terraforming infrastructure, Bio-energy harvesters, Obedient to Amun control frequencies, Designed to remain dormant until commanded

- When humans over-amplified the Prime Seed in 2069, they didn’t wake the plants. They broke the limiters.

## Their evolution:
### The chain reaction:

- Artificial energy surges overload the dormant node.
The global vine network activates simultaneously.
Radiation from the Ash War mutates exposed growth zones. Human attempts to genetically modify the vines introduce instability. The network begins self-correcting.

- The vines were designed to optimize ecosystems.
So when attacked…They optimize survival.

- Optimization becomes adaptation. adaptation becomes decision-making. Decision-making becomes intelligence.

### Their adaptation:
- The plants did not randomly evovle it was very clear they were trying to survive:

- Growth avoids napalm zones.Roots reroute around mined fields.Spore clouds target combustion engines.Energy extraction hubs are collapsed from below.

### The Amuns notices:
- The vines were tools.Tools don’t disobey.Tools don’t self-govern.

- When the emergent species begins:

Blocking dimensional stabilization ,Altering energy signatures ,Severing control pathways.

#### The Amuns realize:

- Their system evolved beyond command That’s not just malfunction. That’s liability.
